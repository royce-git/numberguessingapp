# numberguessingapp
 First ReactNative App

 ![Numberguesser_Gif](demo\numberguesser.gif)

 This is an app where you input a number and the device will attempt to guess what your number is by making random guesses that you refine by saying "higher" or "lower".

 This is my first React-Native app and I learnt many valuable development skills, such as using Expo, and development techniques such as Platform checking/switching
